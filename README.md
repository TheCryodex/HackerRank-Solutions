# HackerRank-Solutions
This repo contains some of my Python 3 solutions to problems on HackerRank platform.


Some of the solutions are optimal while some are just plain brute force approaches. 

I will continue adding solutions to more problem as I get time and as I get better at Competitive Programming.

I hope this repo helps people new to competitive programming.
